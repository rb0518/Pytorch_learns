# FCN

In 2015, CVPR published a paper entitled ``Full Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation``,written by Jonathan Long, Evan Shelhamer and Trevor Darrell, which from UC Berkeley. This paper proposed the concept of full convolution, and extended the end-to-end convolution network to the task of semantic segmentation for the first time. Then there were many network structures based on FCN, such as u-net.
